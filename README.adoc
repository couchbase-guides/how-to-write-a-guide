= Getting started with writing a Guide

With this guide you'll learn how to create a guide.

== What you'll build

You'll build a a guide in ASCIIdoc with the appropriate metadata, images, code imports, and a minimum of informational sections. You will build it and push it to a Github repository in the couchbase-guides organization:

----
https://github.com/couchbase-guides
----

In this demonstration, I'll be using a JavaScript "hello world" page as a hypothetical guie.

== What you'll need

* 15-30 minutes to complete this guide.
* link:http://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidoxFX]
* A browser that can run JavaScript (I'm using Chrome)
* Images or some way to take screenshots.
* A text editor (to write JavaScript)

== How to complete this guide

This guide assumes you are able to use Git.

== Build Setup

Create a new folder and initialize a git repository there. Copy the `starter\README.adoc.template` file from this repository to that folder. At this point, you may want to consider a .gitignore file, depending on the code/IDE that you'll be using. In this example, I do not need one.

Copy the `LICENSE` files into the repo as well. `LICENSE.code.text` covers the code in guide. `LICENSE.writing.txt` covers the writing in the README.adoc file.

Open the README.adoc.template in AsciidocFX. You should see a basic skeleton of a document in AsciiDoc format, and a preview pane.

== Code

In this section, you can start showing code examples and providing commentary. You may want to break up this section with some sub headings. Examples: `=== subheading` or `==== further subheading`.

==== Meta Data

Start your document with some meta data.

```
:imagesdir: images
:couchbase_version: current
:toc:
:project_id: gs-intro-to-js
:icons: font
:source-highlighter: prettify
:tags: javascript,ecmasscript,js
```

The `:imagesdir:` meta data indicates which folder you are going to put images in. Even if you don't plan to use images right away, it's still a good idea to add this in case you change your mind.

Since these guides are Couchbase focused, it's good to indicate the Couchbase version with `:couchbase_version:`.

`:toc:` indicates that a Table of Contents should be generated using the headings.

`:tags:` should be useful information about the content of your guide.

There are three main sections that you'll need: Build, Code, Run. You should also have a "What you'll need" and "What you'll build" sections before Build just to give an introduction. Use `==` to denote each section. For instance: `== What you'll need` or `== Code`.

==== Embedding code

If you want to embed literal code, use the ``` back tick. For instance, `this is inside of single back ticks`. To add multiple lines, use triple back ticks. For instance:

```
this
is
inside of
triple back ticks
```

Another way to embed code is to use ASCIIdoc to include it. Here's an example of a file being included:

```
[source,javascript]
----
include::starter_complete/helloworld.js[]
----
```

That will embed the entire text of `helloworld.js` in the document dynamically, like so:

[source,javascript]
----
include::starter_complete/helloworld.js[]
----

If you can do this, it's preferable to embedding the source code. This way, as you make changes, the AsciiDoc will be updated automatically.

==== Adding images

Including screenshots is very helpful in creating guides, especially the "Run" portion.

The AsciiDoc syntax for images is:

```
image::tree.jpg[put alt text here Alt text]
```

Earlier, we defined `:imagesdir:` meta data to "images", so that will look for `tree.png` in the images subfolder. It will render like this:

image::tree.jpg[put alt text here Alt text]

==== Adding links

Make sure to add links to _at least_ developer.couchbase.com. The link syntax looks like:

```
link:/https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Linq2Couchbase[Linq2Couchbase]
```

Which renders like: link:/https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Linq2Couchbase[Linq2Couchbase]

== Run

The "Run" area is a good place to show screenshots of the completed project in action.

We're going to use this section to highlight some tips to use when writing guides:

* Use second person. This means "you" and "we", not "I" or "he".
* Put class names, filenames, command line examples, etc inside of single ticks, `like so`
* Stick to the Setup-Build-Run format
* Create a `starter` folder and a `starter_complete` folder. In `starter`, put a barebones project that the learner will use to copy/paste from the guide into. In `starter_complete`, put the completed product.
** The learner will have something to fall back on in case they don't something right or miss something subtle.
** You will have completed code files to reference in your document.

== Summary

In this section, you can say something like "Congratulations! You've just created X." It's also a final opportunity to sum up and recommend other guides or links.
