= Getting started with JavaScript

With this guide you'll learn how to create a "Hello, World" JavaScript program.

== What you'll build

You'll build an HTML document that will load and run a JavaScript file. You'll be able to view that web page locally at an address like:

----
file:///C:/work/couchbase-guides/how-to-write-a-guide/starter_complete/helloworld.html
----

This JavaScript code will display a message in an alert box, and also in the JavaScript console.

== What you'll need

* 1-5 minutes
* A text editor.
* A browser.

== How to complete this guide

This guide assumes you are able to use a text editor and open an HTML file locally with a browser of your choice.

== Build Setup

Get the "starter" source code sample that we've made available. Open git bash, clone the repo using `git clone` command.

From the text editor of your choice, open the source files. You won't need to make any changes to `helloworld.html`, but you will be writing code in `helloworld.js`.

== Code

Add this code to `helloworld.js`:

[source,javascript]
include::starter_complete/helloworld.js[]

The first line of this code will write a string to the JavaScript console.

The second line invokes the 'alert' dialog, which causes the browser to create popup with the text specified.

== Run

Now open the `helloworld.html` file in your browser. You can do this by dragging-and-dropping the HTML file into your browser. Depending on your setup and operating system, you may also be able to do this by double-clicking on the HTML file directly.

When you load the page, you should immediately see an alert box output. Here is what it looks like in Chrome on Windows (your view may vary).

Next, open up the JavaScript console to see the message written there. How you do this will depend on your browser, but in Chrome on Windows, you can use `Ctrl-Shift-J`.

== Summary

Congratulations! You just wrote your first JavaScript program.
